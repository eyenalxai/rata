# Issue tracker: Linear

Issues and specs for this repository live in Linear. Use the `rata` CLI for all
operations.

## Conventions

- **Read the context**: `rata status --json` shows the repository, workspace,
  team, project, issue defaults and viewer in one call. It works without a link.
  When the stored team key is stale, it exits 0, sets `team` and `defaults` to
  `null`, and adds a `warning` that names the key and the repair: run
  `rata team list`, then `rata link --team <key>`. Human output prints the
  warning to standard error.
- **Shape the output**: `--json` is global and works before or after the
  subcommand. A read of one resource prints the resource object. A list prints
  `{ <plural>, pageInfo }`. A context document keeps its named sections.
  `--fields` trims a read command to dotted paths that start at that resource;
  for a list the paths apply to each row, and for `config show` they apply to the
  `defaults` object. For example
  `rata issue list --json --fields identifier,title,state.name`; it needs
  `--json` and is valid on `status`, `issue show`, `issue status`, `next`,
  `why`, `issue section get`, `issue list`, `search`, `team show`, `team list`,
  `label list`, `project list` and `config show`. A failed `--json` command
  writes one `error` object to stderr and exits with the code of its class: 2
  validation, 3 not found, 4 conflict, 5 auth, 6 retryable, 1 internal. Its
  fields are `code`, `message` and `hint`. Parse that object instead of the
  prose.
- **Discover the workflow states**: `rata team show --json` lists every state
  with its name and type, plus the labels, members and priorities. Do not guess
  a state name.
- **Create an issue**: `rata issue create --title "..." --body-file -`. Pipe the
  body with a heredoc. `create` applies the repository issue defaults. Pass
  `--label` to add labels to the defaults, or `--no-default-labels` to drop
  them for one call. `create --parent` waits up to 5 seconds for the child to
  appear under the parent; `--wait <seconds>` changes the bound.
- **Set the priority**: every issue must carry a priority. Pass `--priority`
  when you create the issue; triage sets it for issues that arrive without one.
  Values: `urgent` (breaks production or blocks a release), `high` (blocks other
  work), `medium` (the fallback), `low` (nice-to-have). Change it with
  `rata issue update <ref> --priority <value>`.
- **Assign the issue**: every issue must be assigned to the authenticated user.
  Pass `--assignee me` when you create the issue; triage assigns `me` to issues
  that arrive without an assignee. Change it with `rata issue assign <ref> --assignee me`,
  or clear it with `rata issue unassign <ref>`. Wayfinder maps and children are
  the exception: they stay unassigned until the claim step. Use
  `--assignee none` to skip the repository default for one call. The assignee is
  a flag: `rata issue assign <ref> me` is a validation error and the hint names
  the canonical form.
- **Set the repository defaults**: `rata config set --assignee me --label enhancement --priority medium`
  makes them the defaults for every new issue in this repository.
  `rata config show --json` reads them. `rata config unset --label` clears one
  field.
- **Preview a write**: add `--dry-run` to any issue write: `issue create`,
  `issue update`, `issue section append`, `issue section replace`,
  `issue comment create`, `issue comment update`, `issue comment delete`,
  `issue link`, `unlink`, `assign`, `unassign`, `label add`, `label remove`,
  `close` or `reopen`, or to `config set` and `config unset`. A repeated
  idempotent write exits 0 and reports `skipped`.
- **Read an issue**: `rata issue show <ref> --json`. One call returns one issue
  object at the top level: the issue fields plus its comments, children,
  relations and attachments. Add `--no-comments` to skip the comment fetch;
  `--comments` and `--no-comments` are mutually exclusive. `--summary` reads the
  header fields only; it rejects `--comments`. `--no-body`, `--no-relations`,
  `--no-children` and `--no-attachments` drop those parts and skip their
  fetches. `view` is an alias for `show`. Do not write `rata issue <ref>`: the
  group exits 2 and its hint names `issue show`. The issue carries `createdAt`
  and `updatedAt`; pass `updatedAt` to `--if-unchanged` before a body write.
- **Read the issue status**: `rata issue status <ref> --json` returns one flat
  object: the issue summary plus `blocked`, `blockedBy`, `prs` and `nextChild`.
  The PR projection reads the Linear `github` attachments; checks and the merge
  commit are `null`. The next child ignores the assignee, unlike `next`. A
  missing issue exits `3`.
- **Edit one section**: `rata issue section replace <ref> "<heading>" --body-file -`
  is the safe body write. It replaces the content under one heading and keeps
  the rest of the body. The heading match is exact and case-sensitive. Read the
  issue first, preview the diff, then write against that snapshot:
  `rata issue show <ref> --summary --json`,
  `rata issue section replace <ref> "<heading>" --body-file - --dry-run`, then
  the same call with `--if-unchanged <updatedAt>`. `--dry-run` prints a unified
  diff, and `--if-unchanged` fails with `conflict` when the issue changed since
  the read. The body holds the content under the heading, without the heading
  line. A deeper heading belongs to the section: write it too, or the write
  drops it. `rata issue section get <ref> "<heading>"` prints that content, and
  `--with-heading` adds the heading line.
- **Add content**: `issue section append <ref> "<heading>" --body-file -` adds
  to the end of one section, or creates a missing heading at the end of the
  body; `--level` sets its level. `append` only adds. It never replaces text.
- **Do not rewrite the whole body for one section**: `issue update --body-file`
  replaces the whole body, so a heading that the new body leaves out is lost
  without an error. A mission log and gate evidence are never a whole-body
  rewrite. A duplicate heading is the one exception: `section replace` refuses
  it as `ambiguous`. Rename one heading with `issue update --body-file`, then
  edit by section.
- **Append to the body**: `rata issue update <ref> --body-file - --append`. A
  blank line separates the old and the new content.
- **List issues**: `rata issue list` with the filters you need. Useful filters:
  `--team`, `--project`, `--state`, `--state-type`, `--priority`, `--label`,
  `--assignee`, `--parent`, `--text`, `--unblocked`, `--unassigned`. Add
  `--include relations` to put the six relation groups on every row:
  `blocks`, `blockedBy`, `duplicates`, `duplicatedBy`, `related` and `similar`.
  It is one list request per page with no per-child read. Each outgoing or
  inverse connection holds up to 250 relations; `related` and `similar` merge
  both. The flag accepts `relations` only. Every list command returns one page:
  `--limit` is the page size (default 50, maximum 250), and `--after <cursor>`
  continues a list. Add `--all` to drain every page. See **Paging lists**.
- **Comment on an issue**: `rata issue comment create <ref> --body-file -`. The
  form `rata issue comment <ref>` exits 2 and its hint names
  `issue comment create`. The command waits up to 5 seconds for the comment to
  appear on a re-read. Use `--wait <seconds>` to change the bound, or `--wait 0`
  to skip the check. A timeout still exits 0; the write succeeded. Add
  `--dedupe-key <key>` to make a retried comment idempotent: the same key on the
  same issue returns `skipped` with the existing comment. Use
  `issue comment update <comment-id>` and `issue comment delete <comment-id> --yes`
  to change or remove one. Combine an issue update and a comment with
  `issue update <ref> --comment "..."`.
- **Apply / remove labels**: `rata issue label add <ref> <label...>` and
  `rata issue label remove <ref> <label...>`
- **Repair a parent's children**: `rata issue assign --parent <ref> --assignee me`
  and `rata issue label add|remove --parent <ref> <label...>` write to every
  child, open and closed. With `--parent`, every positional of a label command is
  a label. A bad reference or a missing label aborts the batch before any write;
  add `--dry-run` to preview the results. This is for a spec's tickets, not a
  wayfinder map: claim a map's children one by one as the frontier moves.
- **Close**: `rata issue close <ref> --comment "..."`
- **Search**: `rata search "..."`

An issue reference accepts an identifier (`ABC-42`), a UUID, or a linear.app
issue URL. The repository config names the default team, project and workspace
profile, so most commands need no `--team`. `issue list` and the other list
commands default to the linked team; without a link they fail and ask for
`--team` or `rata link`. Run `rata link` once to set it: every subdirectory and
every worktree of the repository finds it. On first use, rata imports a legacy
`.rata.json` into the database and removes the file. When the remove fails, rata
prints a warning to standard error and the command proceeds.

Command forms are canonical. `issue show <ref>` reads one issue, `issue view` is
its only alias, `issue comment create <ref>` writes a comment, and
`issue assign <ref> --assignee <me|none|id>` assigns. A bare `issue <ref>`, a
direct `issue comment <ref>`, and a positional assignee are validation errors
whose hints name the canonical form.

## Paging lists

Every user-facing list command returns one page per call: `issue list`,
`search`, `team list`, `project list` and `label list`. `--limit` is the page
size (default 50, maximum 250). `--after <cursor>` continues a list. Add `--all`
to drain every page; `--limit` stays the page size and `--after` starts from the
cursor. JSON is `{ <plural>, pageInfo }`: `pageInfo.hasNextPage` says whether a
next page exists, and `pageInfo.endCursor` is the cursor for `--after`. With
`--all`, `pageInfo` is `{ "hasNextPage": false, "endCursor": null }`. Keep the
filters and the order fixed across pages: a cursor is bound to its query. Lists
are ordered by creation time (`createdAt`); `search` keeps Linear's relevance
ranking, so its paging is best effort. Internal reads drain every page, so
`issue show` is complete.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** Linear holds issues only. When this repository
treats external pull requests as feature requests, triage them where they live
and mirror the outcome here.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a Linear issue with `rata issue create`. A spec is an issue too: see
**Specs and tickets**.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `rata issue show <ref> --json`.

## Specs and tickets

A **spec** is an issue. Do not create a project for it and do not put `Spec:`
in its title. The spec's **tickets** are its child issues, so the set stays
together under the spec. This repository does not use Linear projects.

- **Publish a spec**: `rata issue create --title "<title>" --label ready-for-agent --priority medium --assignee me --body-file -`.
- **Publish the tickets**: create each ticket as a child of the spec:
  `rata issue create --title "..." --parent <spec-ref> --label ready-for-agent --priority medium --assignee me --body-file -`.
  Wire the blocking edges with
  `rata issue link <ticket-ref> --blocked-by <blocker-ref>`.
- **Implement the spec**: `/implement-spec` fetches the whole set in one call:
  `rata issue list --parent <spec-ref> --all --json --include relations`. Each
  row then carries its blocking edges, so the frontier needs no per-child read.
  `rata issue show <spec-ref> --json` also lists the children.
- **Close the spec**: when every ticket is Done, close the spec with a comment
  that points at the result: `rata issue close <spec-ref> --comment "..."`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`,
with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: `rata issue create --title "..." --label wayfinder:map --no-default-labels --assignee none --body-file -`.
- **Child ticket**: `rata issue create --title "..." --parent <map-ref> --label wayfinder:<type> --no-default-labels --assignee none --body-file -`.
  The type labels are `wayfinder:research`, `wayfinder:prototype`,
  `wayfinder:grilling` and `wayfinder:task`. Leave map and children
  unassigned: the claim step assigns them. The priority default still applies.
- **Blocking**: native Linear relations. Wire an edge with
  `rata issue link <child-ref> --blocked-by <blocker-ref>`, or the inverse with
  `rata issue link <blocker-ref> --blocks <child-ref>`. A ticket is unblocked
  when every issue that blocks it is closed.
- **Frontier**: `rata next --parent <map-ref>` returns the first open, unblocked,
  unclaimed child. The order is priority (urgent first), then the oldest
  `createdAt`. The JSON is the summary object of the ready child, or `null` when
  no child is ready; the command exits 0. It reads every matching page before it
  picks. `--fields` selects from the summary. To read the whole frontier in one
  call, use
  `rata issue list --parent <map-ref> --unblocked --unassigned --include relations --all --json`;
  `--all` drains every page.
- **Why blocked**: `rata why <ref>` prints one level of `blockedBy`. The JSON is
  the issue summary plus `blocked` and `blockedBy`. Each blocker carries its
  state and a `closed` flag; `blocked` is true when any blocker is open. A
  blocker is closed when its state type is `completed` or `canceled`. Human
  output prints `RATA-42 is ready.` when nothing blocks. `--fields` selects from
  the same object.
- **Claim**: `rata issue assign <ref> --assignee me`, the session's first write. The
  assignee is the claim; this is what assigns a wayfinder child.
- **Resolve**: `rata issue comment create <ref> --body-file -`, then
  `rata issue close <ref>`, then append the context pointer (gist plus link) to
  the map's `Decisions so far` section with
  `rata issue section append <map-ref> "Decisions so far" --body-file -`. Add
  `--dry-run` to preview the unified diff, or `--if-unchanged <updatedAt>` to
  fail with `conflict` when the map changed since the read. A missing heading is
  created at the end of the body; `--level` sets its level.
